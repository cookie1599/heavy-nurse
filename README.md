Welcome to Glitch
=================
Issue:
I am using fuzzy search (fusejs.io) to sort title and author names from JSON
I am having problem particulary with fusejs.io and JSON.

Look in the file chat.txt for my discord tag
Look in the file present console log.txt for log.
Thanks!!!


-------------------

What does this discord bot do?

It searches book title from goodreads and 
replies with the best matched bookdata in discord message.

-------------------
 

On the back-end,
- my app starts at `app.js`
- my frameworks and packages in `package.json`
- app secret keys in `.env` (nobody can see this but me and people I invite)
